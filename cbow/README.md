## Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)

The implementation is partially inspired by the assignment of [NLP C2W4](https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-models-in-nlp/home/week/4) 
on Coursera. For theoretical details, please check [this post](http://yueyublog.com/posts/continuous-bag-of-words).

This code uses one of my favourite novels *The Count of Monte Cristo* as the corpus.
